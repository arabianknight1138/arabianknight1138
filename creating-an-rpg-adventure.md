# Creating an RPG adventure

### Outline of adventure plotting

#### 1. Decide on the relationship the story has to the player characters (PC)

* Will your players be using already exists PCs or will they be creating them specifically for this adventure?
*

#### 2. Outline your story

#### 3. Design the key story points

* What will the PCs see?

#### 4. Break the story up into independent pieces

Each piece should be context-free from how the PC's might discover them:

* Locations
* NPCs (friendly and enemy)
* Clues

5\. Compile the relevant materials for the next session
