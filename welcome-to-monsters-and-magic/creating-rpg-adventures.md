# Creating RPG Adventures

## Outlining the Adventuring

{% hint style="info" %}
**Below are the steps I use to create new adventures.**

The format of outlining an adventure does not reflect how a session is run. It is merely intended to facilitate the creation of RPG adventures in a way that makes my brain happy **ðŸ˜Š**

### 1. Decide on the relationship the adventure has to your PCs

### 2. Outline the key story points

What will your PCs see?

### 3. Break up the story

Break the adventure into its component pieces. They should content-free and independent of how the PC's might discover them

#### i. Locations

#### ii. NPCs

This includes both friendly and enemy NPCs

#### iii. Hooks and clues
